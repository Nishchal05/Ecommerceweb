This project is a web application built using Next.js, TailwindCSS, Cloudinary, PostgreSQL, Supabase, and Prisma. It allows users to upload images and interact with a PostgreSQL database. This app is a great example of how to integrate modern technologies like Next.js with cloud services and databases.

Technologies Used
Next.js: React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.

TailwindCSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

Cloudinary: Cloud-based image and video hosting service, used for image uploading.

PostgreSQL: Relational database management system used to store app data.

Supabase: Open-source Firebase alternative, providing real-time databases and authentication.

Prisma: ORM for Node.js and TypeScript that simplifies database access.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure that Node.js is installed. You can download it from nodejs.org.

PostgreSQL: Set up a PostgreSQL database, or use Supabase for a hosted solution.

Cloudinary: Create an account on Cloudinary to get your cloud name and API key.

Features
Image Uploading: Users can upload images using Cloudinary. The images are stored in the Cloudinary cloud and can be accessed using URLs.

PostgreSQL Database: The app connects to a PostgreSQL database (via Supabase and Prisma) to store user data and other related information.

TailwindCSS Styling: The app uses TailwindCSS to create a clean and responsive UI.

Usage
Uploading Images: The app allows users to upload images which are then processed and stored on Cloudinary.

Database Interaction: The app interacts with a PostgreSQL database to fetch, display, and store data (e.g., product listings, user data).

Environment Variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME: Your Cloudinary cloud name (required for image uploading).
DATABASE_URL: The connection string for your PostgreSQL database
